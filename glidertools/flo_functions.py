    Description:
        This function calculates the OOI Level 2 Optical Backscatter data product
        (FLUBSCT_L2), which is calculated using data from the WET Labs, Inc. ECO
        fluorometer family of instruments (FLORD, FLORT, FLNTU) at the wavelength
        specified by the wlngth argument. See Notes.
    Implemented by:
        2013-07-16: Christopher Wingard. Initial Code.
        2014-04-23: Christopher Wingard. Slight revisions to address
                    integration issues and to meet intent of DPS.
        2015-10-26: Russell Desiderio. Deleted default values in argument list.
                                       Revised documentation. Added Notes section.
    Usage:
        bback = flo_bback_total(beta, degC, psu, theta, wlngth, xfactor)
            where
        bback = total (seawater + particulate) optical backscatter coefficient
            at wavelength wlngth (FLUBSCT_L2) [m-1].
        beta = value of the volume scattering function (seawater + particulate) measured
            at angle theta and at wavelength wlngth (FLUBSCT_L1) [m-1 sr-1].
        degC = in situ water temperature from co-located CTD [deg_C].
        psu = in situ salinity from co-located CTD [psu].
        theta = effective (centroid) optical backscatter scattering angle [degrees] which
            is a function of the sensor geometry of the measuring instrument. See Notes.
        wlngth = optical backscatter measurement wavelength [nm]. See Notes.
        xfactor = X (Chi) factor which scales the particulate scattering value at a particular
            backwards angle to the total particulate backscattering coefficient integrated
            over all backwards angles. See Notes.
    Notes:
        The values to be used for theta, chi factor, and wavelength depend on the instrument.
        For WETLabs 'ECO' instruments with 3 optical channels (FLORT D,J,K,M,N,O; FLORD D) the
        centroid angle theta is 124 degrees (not 117 as in WETLabs' older documentation) and the
        appropriate chi factor for these instruments is 1.076 [Sullivan, Twardowski, Zaneveld, and
        Moore, 2013, Table 6.2b, "ECO-BB" (= ECO-BB3)]. The ECO-BB3 was initially mis-classified
        as an OPTAA series M instrument, and is now classified as a FLORT series O instrument.
        For 'ECO' instruments with 2 optical channels (WETLabs models FLBB and FLNTU: FLORD G,L,M
        and the FLNTU component of FLORT A which is now designated as FLNTU series A) the centroid
        angle theta is 140 degrees and the chi factor is 1.096 (Mike Twardowski, personal
        communication).
        All optical backscatter channels of FLORD and FLORT instruments use a light source at
        a nominal wavelength of 700nm. All three optical channels of an ECO-BB3 are backscatter
        channels, typically at 3 different wavelengths in the visible (blue, green and red). The
        wavelength dependence of the chi factor is a subject of current research. At this time
        it is thought to be very weakly dependent on wavelength, if at all, and so the above chi
        factors should be used for scattering calculations involving any visible wavelength
        (Mike Twardowski, personal communication).
        The chi factor is a function of angle and the sensor geometry of the instrument used to
        measure the volume scattering function at a given backwards scattering angle. It is a
        scaling factor relating the particulate scattering at that angle to the particulate
        total backscatter coefficient (the latter is the integral over all backwards angles of the
        volume scattering function due to particles). The chi factor is not an "angular resolution"
        as it has been labelled in the OOI program.
        Depending on context within the documentation the word 'total' can have several meanings:
            (1) seawater + particulate scattering
            (2) forward + backward scattering
            (3) backscatter integrated over all backwards wavelengths.

        animals. It accounts for the tea-like color of some water masses. CDOM
        is not particulate, but water masses can contain both CDOM and
        turbidity. CDOM absorbs ultraviolet light and fluoresces visible blue
        light. The fluorescence of CDOM is used in many applications such as
        continuous monitoring of wastewater discharge, natural tracer of
        specific water bodies, ocean color research and the effect of CDOM on
        satellite imagery, and investigations of CDOM concentrations impacting
        light availability used for primary production.

    Description:
        This function calculates FLUBSCT_L1, the value for the volume scattering
        function measured at the effective measurement angle determined by the
        sensor geometry of the particular instrument used. Most of the FLORD,
        FLORT, and FLNTU instruments measure backscattering at a wavelength of
        700nm (the exception is the FLORT series O ECO-BB3 instrument). For more
        information see the Notes section of the function flo_bback_total in this
        module.
